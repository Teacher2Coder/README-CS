## Description
This application will automatically create a fully fledged README.md for your projects. Just run the application in the command line and you will be prompted to input some information. Once all information has been submitted, a README.md will be added to your project's repository.

## Usage
To use the README Generator:

1. Ensure you have the .NET SDK installed on your machine
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal
3. Run the application using the command: `dotnet run`
4. Follow the interactive prompts to provide:
   - Project name
   - GitHub username
   - Email address
   - Project description
   - Installation instructions
   - License type (choose from the provided options)
   - Contribution guidelines
5. The application will automatically generate a README.md file in the current directory

The generated README.md will include all the necessary sections with your provided information, formatted according to standard markdown conventions.

For added utility, create an alias in your bashprofile following this convention: ```dotnet run <enter path to README-Generator here>```. This will allow you to use this application in whatever directory that you happen to be working in. Any generated README.md will be placed in your current directory.
